# 30 Python projects

I'm fairly new to Python, having just completed a brief course on Linkedin. Figured I better practice what I learned, so here's my attempt at 30 Python project in let's say..... 2 months?

A project every other day seems reasonable.

Here's the list, which i've taken from [here](https://hackr.io/blog/python-projects).

The first project on there is Hangman, which i'm not going to attempt first up with the GUI, so instead i'll replace that project with the first program here, which is to edit this file with a list of all projects listed on that webpage, with the exception of the first one:
